# Hello World Lambda Java

This is a "sam init" template to generate a "Hello World" AWS Lambda function, implemented in Java.

For details on installing the SAM CLI, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

To generate a project using this template, run:

```
$ sam init --location gh:symphoniacloud/sam-init-HelloWorldLambdaJava
```

This is an alternative to the similar project at https://github.com/symphoniacloud/sam-init-HelloWorldLambdaJava-zip . This version produces an artifact in an "Uberjar" format. "Uberjars" are more simple to package and better for when you just get started, however we recommend the ZIP version for production usage.
